# further-study-python

A space to work on all the projects presented during bootcamp to 100% completion.
- This means:
  - all further study sections of every project
  - no starter code will be used, everything is done from scratch
  - some exceptions being projects that rely on Jinga and Vanila JS, that portion of the project will be done in React Typescript but still made to similar specifications of the original lesson plan.
  - Testing. Ideally to 100% if not possible at least maintain above 80%

This repo contains exercises designed to help bootcamp students understand and practice implementing the daily lessons during the Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy portion of the course. Some of the projects are full applications that can serve practical uses but by the nature of these being exercises to help grasp the subject matter, most of them are just toy programs that are fun to play around with.

-Projects that are highlighted as completed and ready for use will be highlighted here and given there own repository if you wish to play around with them.
- so far none...
